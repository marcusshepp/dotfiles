# 🚀 Dotfiles

A meticulously curated collection of development environment configurations, designed for seamless cross-platform development on both Windows and Linux systems.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains my personal development environment configurations, carefully organized to support a consistent experience across multiple machines and operating systems. It includes configurations for terminal emulators, window managers, and development tools, with automated setup scripts for easy deployment.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Windows Environment

- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** - Modern, extensible text editor
- **[GlazeWM](https://github.com/glazewm/glazewm)** - Tiling window manager for Windows
- **[Zebar](https://github.com/zebar/zebar)** - Minimalist status bar
- **[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)** - GPU-accelerated terminal emulator

### Linux Environment

- **[i3](https://i3wm.org/)** - Dynamic tiling window manager
- **[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)** - Fast, feature-rich terminal emulator

## 🔗 Symlink Management

### Current Implementation

Currently, symlinks are manually created to map configuration files from this repository to their respective locations in the system. This ensures that any changes made to the configurations are tracked in version control.

## 🛠️ Planned Improvements

- [ ] Automated symlink creation scripts
- [ ] Version tracking and update notifications
- [ ] Configuration validation tests
- [ ] Cross-platform configuration synchronization
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Plugin version management
- [ ] Documentation for each tool's configuration

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the developers and communities behind all the tools used in this configuration. Their work makes this development environment possible.
Specifically the neovim community, the inspiration I draw from this community is endless.
